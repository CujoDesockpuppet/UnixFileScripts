Directory Size & Hierarchy Scanner
A bash script that recursively scans a specified directory, calculates the size of each subdirectory, and displays the results in a clear, hierarchical format. It's designed to be compatible with both Linux and AIX environments.

üöÄ Features
Recursive Scanning: Finds all subdirectories within a given path.

Directory Sizing: Uses du to calculate the size of each directory in megabytes.

Hierarchical Display: Indents the output to visually represent the directory structure.

OS Compatibility Check: Verifies if the script is running on Linux or AIX.

Input Validation: Checks if the user-provided directory exists before proceeding.
