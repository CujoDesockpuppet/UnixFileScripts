### Overview

This script, written in Bash, helps you visualize the directory structure and file sizes of a specified directory in a hierarchical format. Itâ€™s particularly useful for quickly identifying where disk space is being used on a filesystem. The script is designed to run on both **Linux** and **AIX** operating systems.

The output is read-only and is logged to a unique file in your home directory, in the format `fssizehierarchy_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`.

### How to Use

1.  **Save the Script**: Save the provided Bash code into a file, for example, `fssize.sh`.
2.  **Make it Executable**: Give the script execute permissions using the following command:
    ```sh
    chmod +x fssize.sh
    ```
3.  **Run the Script**: Execute the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    ./fssize.sh
    ```

When you run the script, you will be prompted to enter a directory path. If you don't enter a path, it will default to your home directory (`$HOME`).

### Important Notes

* **Permissions**: To avoid permission errors and get a complete view of the filesystem, it is recommended to run this script as the **root user**.
* **Performance**: Be cautious when running the script on very large filesystems (like `/` or `/usr`). It can take a significant amount of time to complete. For best results, specify a more granular path, such as `/home/user/projects` or `/var/log`.
* **Output**: The script's output will be displayed directly in the terminal and also saved to a log file. A message at the end will tell you the exact location of this log file.

### Script Details

The script performs the following actions:

* **OS Detection**: It first checks if the operating system is either `Linux` or `AIX` to ensure compatibility.
* **Logging**: All script output is captured and saved to a timestamped log file in your home directory.
* **User Input**: It prompts you to enter a directory path and handles empty input by defaulting to your home directory. It also performs basic path validation and correction.
* **Directory Traversal**: Using the `find` and `du` commands, the script recursively goes through all subdirectories.
* **Size Calculation**: It calculates the size of each directory in megabytes (`MB`).
* **Hierarchical Output**: It uses indentation based on the directory depth to visually represent the filesystem hierarchy, making the output easy to read.
